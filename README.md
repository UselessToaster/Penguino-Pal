# Penguino-Pal
Contains all files associated with the design and fabrication of the Penguino Pal

The Penguino Pal was a project for my foundations of engineering class Fall 2020.
The task was to create a follower robot that could fit in a 6 x 6 x 6 in box using an Arduino Uno CPU
designed for children in elementary or middle school. 
My team and I faced many challenges in the fabrication of our robot design, 
especially in light of the pandemic, but we managed to pull off a finished and fully functional product.

In this Repository you will find the details of the part I played in building this robot.
It should be noted that I was the Project Engineering Lead (i.e Team Leader) for this project, 
and NOT the Software Lead.
