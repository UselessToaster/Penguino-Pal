# Penguino-Pal
Contains all files associated with the design and fabrication of the Penguino Pal



This was a project for my 3000L Foundations of Engineering project at USF.
We wre tasked with creating a robot that was to be marketed to children from Elementary to Middle School.

In the brainstorming part of the project each individual student designed their own protoptype,
mine prototype pictured as "Froggy" and viewable as an STL file under the name "Frantic Blorr-KrunK"

After brainstorming, my group, which I was the Project Lead engineer for, decided on a penguin-inspired design-
hence the name Penguino Pal

I spearheaded the designs as our Design Lead was not an active member of the group
and maintained a steady workflow to ensure deadlines were met with quality work to show for it

In this repository you will find documentation of the progression of the project from 2D draft, 
to 3D prototype to actualized 3D model used in fabrication, to the workihng prototype of the product itself.
